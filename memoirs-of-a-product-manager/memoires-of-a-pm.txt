01. Introduction; or what am I writing about and why 

This article (I thought I wanted to write a "book" at first) was initially meant to be a concise, no bullsh*t introduction to the field of product management. 
The reason I wanted to write it in its original form was that, after a few years doing the job at different levels, in different companies.. I felt there were few real, down to earth accounts of what this role meant.

Rather than entertaining the idea that I was some sort of expert that could distill an entire role field into a few pages, I decided to tell my personal story.

My new goal is not as grandious, but is probably more honest and I hope these few pages (I want this to be short on porpose) will give you some inspiration, make you laugh or entertain you in other ways.

This being said, I still want to portray the field of product management at least the way I saw it from my perspective, via a series of anecdotes and personal reflections.

As I write these lines, the next question that pops up in my mind is 
"should I try to outline some chapters or themes from the start of just write down whatever feels right in the moment?" 
- good question, let me try the latter approach and I promise to write a post-scriptum at the end, telling you how it all went and how my writing technique evolved.

02. The beginnings; or about the professional journey that led me to Product Management 

My professional background is not too exciting, but it is worth quickly summarizing it for the sake of context.
My first few jobs (I hopped every year or so) consisted of tech support roles (including at Microsoft) and a short adventure as (Python/Django) developer.
I then did some consulting and later worked as a developer evangelist for one of those huge corporations that few people actualy like (Oracle). The main thing I seem to have been looking for while switching jobs was professional diversity. 
The idea of doing the same thing over and over again for years always scared me so I semi-consciously thought to myself "I'll just change company/role until I find something intereting enough". Avoiding an addiction to a secure and comfortable position was also a reason for actively changing jobs every year or so.

## Tech support

Tech support was interesting because it felt like I solved real problems for real people. They were already getting value from a certain software system and when something didn't work as expected (or at all) and I was able to help them it felt like I was part of the value chain. One of the problems with this type of job is that you don't really feel like you're building something.. you're just fixing one thing after another, almost always talking with frustrated users that sometimes see you as part of the problem.

## Developer

As a developer I got the opposite impression: I built things, they seemed to work, but I lacked real contact with the user, which made my code seem pointless. At the same time I was very young and wanted to travel a bit so when my employer didn't agree to me working remotely and part-time.. I left.

## Consultant

One of the roles that I enjoyed the most was as a consultant working with a large French insurance company to migrate their back-office applications to newer versions. I worked with a remote senior consultant that knew way more than me about the actual software we were working on and also was a great developer and all-round computer guy. My role was to be on-site, capture requirements, answer questions, train the users and write documentation. I like this mix of reponsibilities.

## Product Manager

Product management seemed (and was) the next logical step and this is the reason why I enjoy doing product work so much: depending on the company, product and ways of working you end up working with different groups of people, understanding different perspectives and the level of contribution is only dependant on your willingness to get involved. There will always be someone (usually a dozen people) looking for some sort of help, ranging from documentation, training, troubleshooting, interviewing, prototyping, clarifying requirements, prioritizing features/tickets, finding resources.. even people management and more.

I know, purists will say that's not what a PM should be doing, but in my experience they do and they usually like it. 

Read on for examples and anecdotes.

03. Nuances of Product management; or what this role is and what it is not

## TL;DR

The phrase that you are reading now was written after the rest of this chapter, but I feel it summarizes the answer to the questions "where can I find the most meaningful, interesting and complete product work?" in a good way. You will probably find that work if you are either a founder/cofounder or an early employee of a startup. Read on for a longer answer.

## What does a PM do

The internet is full of memes, articles and threads about what a PM should do and what they should not do.
A large part of this content seems to focus on the differences between product managers and project managers.
From my point of view, the crux of the conversation is actually micromanagement: product managers generally
don't like or want to micromanage others, they prefer to have a wider view of the whole product landscape and to make strategic decisions.
Most companies prefer to maximize the value they get out of each employee and this oftentimes means that PMs
will need to do at least a moderate amount of micromanagement during their standard workday.

Examples of this might mean spending (what seems to be too much) time with engineers explaining requirements or priorities.
It might also mean spending a lot of time doing customers support, which is a valuable user interviewing and user testing activity.
Oftentimes PMs are the "glue" between different other departments and they need to make sure messages are passed correctly and efficiently between marketing, engineering, ops, stakeholders etc.

At the end of the day, it's a matter of personal taste and patience - some prefer to stick to the high level, others are OK with
staying close to the action, sometimes sitting with developers to debug or refine features.

One thing to note is that if you don't have at least a third of your time dedicated to strategic and research activities, you're probably not doing product management, but some sort of mix between project management and technical/people management.

In my career I've met some product managers that lived in the world of presentations and spreadsheets, others that rarely came out of Jira, another category would love to spend their days in analytics tools and interviewing customers, while yet another category seemed very happy around marketing and sales people. Let's not forget about the PM that's basically a tech lead in disguise.

My point of view is that a balanced mix of all of the above is actually ideal. This will depend on where you are in the product lifecycle, how the rest of the product team is structured and a few other factors.

04. Getting educated; degrees, certifications, courses etc.

You don't need them.. but read on.

Some theoretical training is always a good idea, but don't get too caught up with degrees, certifications and courses.
Product management is the type of role that requires a lot of learning on the job, active listening and open mindedness.
While a 2-3 hour course will give you a good theoretical framework that will help you to properly contextualize yourself, your group
and your product.. everything else you need to learn will be on the field, not in the classroom.

Certifications might convince an employer, but it's usually more of a "feel good" piece of paper and doesn't say too much about
your actual product management skills and/or expertise.

How to learn before you get a job or outside of your job? Talk to PMs, play the PM role on smaller projects, maybe help out a friend that's building a product, try to turn your "PM mode" on when using any product, when seeing others use it or deciding what to buy (yes, everything is a product, we buy things on a daily basis, the opportunity to do product analysis work is infinite).

This is (or should be) a real world role, not something you should learn in a classroom.

05. The lifecycle of a product; and how it affects the PM role

As with most topics in this article, you can find more detailed and better refined explanations online or in longer form writings.
The same goes for product lifecycles (that in our case will overlap with software lifecycles).

There are 2 reasons to read about the lifecycle of a product:
- the first one is that, as a product manager, you should be in charge of it
- the second one is that, based on where your product/products are in their (macro-) lifecycle, the PM role will be different

Without further ado, a high-level view of the macro-level lifecycle of a product would look like this:
1. phase 1 - ideation, discovery/research, inception, prototyping
2. phase 2 - stable operation and growth
3. phase 3 - maintenance and sunsetting

What most books, courses and articles talk about when they describe a product manager's responsibilities and day-to-day activities
most often comes from phases 1 and 2. Phase 1 comes with a lot of excitement and a lot of unknowns, phase 2 is more stable,
but you still build new features / revenue streams / partnerships and integrations, tap into new customer segments and look forward to growing your product and its ecosystem.
Phase 3 is usually not so flashy, entails less new development but lots of bug fixing.
