04. Getting educated; degrees, certifications, courses etc.

You don't need them.. but read on.

Some theoretical training is always a good idea, but don't get too caught up with degrees, certifications and courses.
Product management is the type of role that requires a lot of learning on the job, active listening and open mindedness.
While a 2-3 hour course will give you a good theoretical framework that will help you to properly contextualize yourself, your group
and your product.. everything else you need to learn will be on the field, not in the classroom.

Certifications might convince an employer, but it's usually more of a "feel good" piece of paper and doesn't say too much about
your actual product management skills and/or expertise.

How to learn before you get a job or outside of your job? Talk to PMs, play the PM role on smaller projects, maybe help out a friend that's building a product, try to turn your "PM mode" on when using any product, when seeing others use it or deciding what to buy (yes, everything is a product, we buy things on a daily basis, the opportunity to do product analysis work is infinite).

This is (or should be) a real world role, not something you should learn in a classroom.
