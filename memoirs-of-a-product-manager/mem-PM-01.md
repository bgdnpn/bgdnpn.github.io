01. Introduction; or what am I writing about and why 

This article (I thought I wanted to write a "book" at first) was initially meant to be a concise, no bullsh*t introduction to the field of product management. 
The reason I wanted to write it in its original form was that, after a few years doing the job at different levels, in different companies.. I felt there were few real, down to earth accounts of what this role meant.

Rather than entertaining the idea that I was some sort of expert that could distill an entire role field into a few pages, I decided to tell my personal story.

My new goal is not as grandious, but is probably more honest and I hope these few pages (I want this to be short on porpose) will give you some inspiration, make you laugh or entertain you in other ways.

This being said, I still want to portray the field of product management at least the way I saw it from my perspective, via a series of anecdotes and personal reflections.

As I write these lines, the next question that pops up in my mind is 
"should I try to outline some chapters or themes from the start of just write down whatever feels right in the moment?" 
- good question, let me try the latter approach and I promise to write a post-scriptum at the end, telling you how it all went and how my writing technique evolved.
