03. Nuances of Product management; or what this role is and what it is not

## TL;DR

The phrase that you are reading now was written after the rest of this chapter, but I feel it summarizes the answer to the questions "where can I find the most meaningful, interesting and complete product work?" in a good way. You will probably find that work if you are either a founder/cofounder or an early employee of a startup. Read on for a longer answer.

## What does a PM do

The internet is full of memes, articles and threads about what a PM should do and what they should not do.
A large part of this content seems to focus on the differences between product managers and project managers.
From my point of view, the crux of the conversation is actually micromanagement: product managers generally
don't like or want to micromanage others, they prefer to have a wider view of the whole product landscape and to make strategic decisions.
Most companies prefer to maximize the value they get out of each employee and this oftentimes means that PMs
will need to do at least a moderate amount of micromanagement during their standard workday.

Examples of this might mean spending (what seems to be too much) time with engineers explaining requirements or priorities.
It might also mean spending a lot of time doing customers support, which is a valuable user interviewing and user testing activity.
Oftentimes PMs are the "glue" between different other departments and they need to make sure messages are passed correctly and efficiently between marketing, engineering, ops, stakeholders etc.

At the end of the day, it's a matter of personal taste and patience - some prefer to stick to the high level, others are OK with
staying close to the action, sometimes sitting with developers to debug or refine features.

One thing to note is that if you don't have at least a third of your time dedicated to strategic and research activities, you're probably not doing product management, but some sort of mix between project management and technical/people management.

In my career I've met some product managers that lived in the world of presentations and spreadsheets, others that rarely came out of Jira, another category would love to spend their days in analytics tools and interviewing customers, while yet another category seemed very happy around marketing and sales people. Let's not forget about the PM that's basically a tech lead in disguise.

My point of view is that a balanced mix of all of the above is actually ideal. This will depend on where you are in the product lifecycle, how the rest of the product team is structured and a few other factors.
