05. The lifecycle of a product; and how it affects the PM role

As with most topics in this article, you can find more detailed and better refined explanations online or in longer form writings.
The same goes for product lifecycles (that in our case will overlap with software lifecycles).

There are 2 reasons to read about the lifecycle of a product:
- the first one is that, as a product manager, you should be in charge of it
- the second one is that, based on where your product/products are in their (macro-) lifecycle, the PM role will be different

Without further ado, a high-level view of the macro-level lifecycle of a product would look like this:
1. phase 1 - ideation, discovery/research, inception, prototyping
2. phase 2 - stable operation and growth
3. phase 3 - maintenance and sunsetting

What most books, courses and articles talk about when they describe a product manager's responsibilities and day-to-day activities
most often comes from phases 1 and 2. Phase 1 comes with a lot of excitement and a lot of unknowns, phase 2 is more stable,
but you still build new features / revenue streams / partnerships and integrations, tap into new customer groups and look forward to growing your product and its ecosystem.
Phase 3 is usually not so flashy, entails less new development but lots of bug fixing.
