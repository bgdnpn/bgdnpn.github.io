02. The beginnings; or about the professional journey that led me to Product Management 

My professional background is not too exciting, but it is worth quickly summarizing it for the sake of context.
My first few jobs (I hopped every year or so) consisted of tech support roles (including at Microsoft) and a short adventure as (Python/Django) developer.
I then did some consulting and later worked as a developer evangelist for one of those huge corporations that few people actualy like (Oracle). The main thing I seem to have been looking for while switching jobs was professional diversity. 
The idea of doing the same thing over and over again for years always scared me so I semi-consciously thought to myself "I'll just change company/role until I find something intereting enough". Avoiding an addiction to a secure and comfortable position was also a reason for actively changing jobs every year or so.

## Tech support

Tech support was interesting because it felt like I solved real problems for real people. They were already getting value from a certain software system and when something didn't work as expected (or at all) and I was able to help them it felt like I was part of the value chain. One of the problems with this type of job is that you don't really feel like you're building something.. you're just fixing one thing after another, almost always talking with frustrated users that sometimes see you as part of the problem.

## Developer

As a developer I got the opposite impression: I built things, they seemed to work, but I lacked real contact with the user, which made my code seem pointless. At the same time I was very young and wanted to travel a bit so when my employer didn't agree to me working remotely and part-time.. I left.

## Consultant

One of the roles that I enjoyed the most was as a consultant working with a large French insurance company to migrate their back-office applications to newer versions. I worked with a remote senior consultant that knew way more than me about the actual software we were working on and also was a great developer and all-round computer guy. My role was to be on-site, capture requirements, answer questions, train the users and write documentation. I like this mix of reponsibilities.

## Product Manager

Product management seemed (and was) the next logical step and this is the reason why I enjoy doing product work so much: depending on the company, product and ways of working you end up working with different groups of people, understanding different perspectives and the level of contribution is only dependant on your willingness to get involved. There will always be someone (usually a dozen people) looking for some sort of help, ranging from documentation, training, troubleshooting, interviewing, prototyping, clarifying requirements, prioritizing features/tickets, finding resources.. even people management and more.

I know, purists will say that's not what a PM should be doing, but in my experience they do and they usually like it.
