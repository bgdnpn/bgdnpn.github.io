Okay, here's a concise take on why "vibe coding" and "vibe planning" won't cut it, and how you need real product management to succeed:

While the promise of creative, intuitive product development ("vibe coding," "vibe planning") might sound appealing, it's a recipe for chaos. Without a solid foundation in product strategy, market validation, and rigorous execution, you'll quickly find yourself with a product that no one understands, let alone uses. True product success hinges on elements like maintaining a reliable and clear product roadmap, robust testing, and ensuring scalability.
