      The fundamental problem with building roadmaps is that, in an agile environment, your plan should change
      at least every few iterations. If it doesn't, you're just following the initial plan, hence not being agile.

      We should build vision maps instead of roadmaps.

      A vision map displays where you envision your product or business will be in the future.
      From it you can build your dynamic development plan and then improve it based on user feedback and market context.

      Roadmaps are static and pretend to know the future.
